ABSALOM, ABSALOM!: Absalom, the third son of David, rebelled against his father and was killed in battle.
A TIME TO KILL: The anonymous author is a King of Jerusalem who relates and analyses events in his own life.

THE HOUSE OF MIRTH: A brilliant sentence: The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
